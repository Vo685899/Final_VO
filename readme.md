## Project Description 
This project includes fundamental gameplay through the classic game Snake. 

You are introduced to the game with a welcome screen, describing the rules to the game. The information includes how to naviagate through the game using arrow keys, to eat the colorful circles which are food and to avoid the black boxes which are obstacles. 

At the initial start of gameplay, you are shown a screen with your current score and your high score for the day. Those numbers move as you eat more food. 

You are unable to die if you have not consumed any food. 

Once you start navigating through the game, you can die three ways
- Running into a obstacle
- Running off the edge of the screen
- Running into the tail of the snake

Upon dying, you recieve a death screen and can restart the game.

Otherwise the game will continue and your highscore will continue to be tracked. 

Happy playing!
